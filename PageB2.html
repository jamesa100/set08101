				<p> You raise your shield as the skeleton swing his sword. You block the hit and follow up with a slash from your sword,
				<br/> you land a critical hit and the skeleton is reduced to ash. As the dark presence fades you hear a loud crash as the wall to your left collapses. 
				<br/> You make your escape through this hole and pray for freedom. THE END
