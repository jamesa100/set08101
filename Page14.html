				<p>	You reach the top of the well, gasping for air. You find yourself in a large room. It appears to be some sort of old armoury with weapons and armour on the walls. You noticed bones scattered around the room. It is likely someone has died here long ago.
				<br/>A.	Look around the room.
				<br/>B.	Grab some items.
				<br/>C.	Inspect the bones.
