				<p> As you pick up the sword a feeling of warmth flows through you body you begin to feel faster and stronger than before. 
				<br/> You continue to search the room further and notice the bones have all disappeared as you sense a dark presence nearby. 
				<br/> From across the room a skeleton warrior lunge at you. With this newfound power you thrust your sword at the monster, 
				<br/> swinging with all your might you land a critical hit and the skeleton is reduced to ash. As the dark presence fades you hear a 
				<br/> loud crash as the wall to your left collapses. You make your escape through this hole and pray for freedom. THE END
